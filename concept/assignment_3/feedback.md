# Project Feedback

## 1. Stories
Back button should not be a story

## 2. App functionality
+ Storage - should download into the pictures folder directly

## 3. UI
+ UI should also be available on landscape version
+ Data binding, XML layouts
+ migrate to jetpack compose
+ Rounded corners for pictures
+ "Choose one to download" button should appear after loading the pictures
+ There is a white line on one view that should be removed

## 4. Business Logic
+ should be in view model, not fragment
+ At the moment it does not survive display rotations
+ Thread to viewmodel as Kotlin coroutines

## 5. Others
+ Add view models
+ unified message style for commits
+ correct small lint warnings
+ documentation of functions
+ koin to inject repo
+ More thorough error handling
