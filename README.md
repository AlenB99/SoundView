## Preamble & Disclaimer

This **Android Application** is provided by Alen Bisanovic and Vlad Popescu-Vifor. The goal of this project is to create an innovative app by applying important concepts of the Android SDK and its related components in combination with several API's. 


## Project Overview & Architecture

The main goal of our app is generating an AI illustration that would match the lyrics of a song [(User Story 1)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/1).
Our concept of the app would be having the phone listen to a song, obtain its name using ShazamSDK [(User Story 3)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/3), then use the name to obtain the lyrics of the song using a lyrics API. Afterwards, NLP would be applied on the lyrics for the most important words found in the text. These words would then be entered into the Stable-Diffusion API, which will generate an AI image based on those words. 
Additionally, the user will also be able to view a history of the generated images [(User Story 2)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/2) and save them to the local storage of the mobile phone [User Story 7](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/7). Another important feature is manually entering a song name [(User Story 5)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/5) and viewing its lyrics [(User Story 4)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/4), as well as NLP statistics based on the text [(User Story 8)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/8). A history of the previous scanned songs would also be available for the user to re-select [(User Story 6)](https://student.inso.tuwien.ac.at/mobile-app-software-engineering/ws22/track-a-team-09-android/-/issues/6).
